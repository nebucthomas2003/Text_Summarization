# Text Summarization with AI

Welcome to the Text Summarization with AI repository! This project, developed as part of an internship, focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to automatically generate summaries from large volumes of text.

## Features

- **Summarization Models:** Explore AI-powered summarization techniques, including extractive and abstractive methods.
- **Model Training:** Access pre-trained models or train your own using custom datasets.
- **Evaluation Tools:** Evaluate the quality of generated summaries using standard metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation to guide you through using the provided models and tools effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Pip (Python package installer)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nebucthomas2003/Text_Summarization.git
cd Text_Summarization
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nebucthomas2003/Text_Summarization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Text_Summarization
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Loading Data

1. **Load your dataset:** Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format and directory. For example, you can place your text files in a directory named `data/`.

### Running the Application

1. **Launch the summarization app:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Using the app:**
   - The app provides a user-friendly interface for summarizing text. Enter your article text in the provided textbox.
   - Choose the summarization type from the options: "Abstractive", "Extractive (TF-IDF)", or "Extractive (TextRank)".
   - Click the "Submit" button to generate the summary.
   - The generated summary will be displayed in the output textbox.

### Evaluating Summaries

1. **Evaluate the quality of the generated summaries:**
   - Use the provided evaluation tools to assess the quality of the summaries using metrics such as ROUGE.
   - Evaluation scripts can be found in the `evaluation` directory.

## File Descriptions

- `app.py`: Main application script that integrates both extractive (TF-IDF and TextRank) and abstractive summarization models. It provides a Gradio interface for user interaction.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for the project.
- `saved_model/`: Directory containing the pre-trained BART model for abstractive summarization.
- `data/`: Directory to store your datasets.
- `evaluation/`: Directory containing scripts for evaluating the quality of generated summaries.
