Welcome to the Text Summarization with AI repository! This project, developed as part of an internship, focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to automatically generate summaries from large volumes of text.

## Features

- **Summarization Models:** Explore AI-powered summarization techniques, including extractive and abstractive methods.
- **Model Training:** Access pre-trained models or train your own using custom datasets.
- **Evaluation Tools:** Evaluate the quality of generated summaries using standard metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation to guide you through using the provided models and tools effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Text_Summarization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
